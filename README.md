# instagram-competitor-analytics
This Software allows you to make a deep analysis of an entire Instagram niche. The algorithms combines Artificial Intelligence and Traditional Data Analysis.

# How it works?
You just need to insert your Instagram account username. Then the software will find all account similar to yours and will elaborate all datas necessary. Will do everything by itself. The output consists in N .html files (where N is the number of account similar to yours found) that shows all data analysis of each account.
PS. Can find an example of the output in /example directory.

# How to use it?
The usage of this software is really basic. Just download all the file enumerated and run them in the same order.
Python version used in this software is 3.7.3 and idk if it works on other version.

I haven't done the requirements file because idk really well how to make it and because I don't remember the version of package used. This is an old project.
PS.This project is 1 yr old. Some bugs with new library version could occurr.
